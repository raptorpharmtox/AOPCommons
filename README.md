The JUPYTER notebook is designed to be uploaded to Google Colab. So I'm going to host it in my google drive as a template. Then others can copy the template and make it their own. 

We will have versions of the notebook for others to use as a guide on Github.

We will also offer training on how to use it.

We will host hackathons.

We will talk about how we envision the project -- so I'll need to do a webinar.

Eventually, we will need to write code to hook all of the AOPs together and put them into a cloud-hosted Neo4J graph database. Then we will start hooking those up with commercially available assays.

We will also need a web-based GUI that people can run to overlay their data onto the AOPs, or onto the AOP network. 

Ultimately I will want to be able to come up with a batter of in vitro assays that covers a large swath of space.

Commercial vendors can pay to advertise in the system to have their assays listed at the top of our results.
